It's proving hard.

At the time of writing this site is back using the default Jekyll permalink format:

site/category/year/month/day/title

Which also reflects the directory structure.

I'd like to use:

site/title

This is how I have permalinks set up on WordPress. It would be relativly simple to switch the site to Jekyll if I could keep the exact same structure. 

I found how to get permalinks I wanted, but ran into problems with the internal linking structure on the site. 

If you've experienced this problem and solved it, I'd be interested to hear how you managed.
